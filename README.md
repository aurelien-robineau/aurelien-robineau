Hi there 👋! I am a french student in web & mobile development at Sorbonne Université.

### Motivation ⚡
My biggest motivation is to produce the best code possible.  
I want it clean, scalable and well-documented 👊!  
I know I have still a lot to learn 🌱. And that is what I am doing every day trying to improve my code.
